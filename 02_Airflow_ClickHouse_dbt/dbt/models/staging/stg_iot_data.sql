-- Staging: transform long IoT readings into a wide table per hour with averages
-- Contract:
--   Input  (bronze_iot_raw_data): ingestion_ts DateTime, entity_id String, state String, last_changed DateTime, attributes String
--   Output (view): one row per hour with average values per measurement
-- Notes:
--   - Values are cast to Float64 where possible (non-numeric -> NULL)
--   - Aggregated to hourly averages using toStartOfHour()
